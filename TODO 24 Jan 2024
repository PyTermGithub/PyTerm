# TODO :x:

Start date: `24 Jan 2024` - End Date: `not complete`

## Create support for folders :x:

Allow folders in PyMrk/Snippets and read all files inside of folders casually, it will not matter if you have a "subfolder"

After this change I will also stop pkg from destroying the folder and moving all files into PyMrk/ Snippets instead of PyMrk/Snippets/{repo name}, this is for another feature*

## Stop including folders with _hidden inside of engine.Engine.files :x:

This is also kind of related to the "create support for folders" task, it will just not read the contents of _hidden and will not include it on engine.Engine.files

## work more on package installer :x:

Add more paramaters and support for more package libraries (even if git is enough).

* I will add the ability to delete packages which links to create support for folders

## create a command that lists all commands :white_check_mark:

Will probably just use `os.listdir('./PyMrk/Snippets)` or something like that

## create PyMrk/Man for Man pages :white_check_mark:

Developers can create files with their name to be read as man pages in the command `man {command name}`

This seems the simplest since my engine already has the tools inside of `pymrk_convert()` half done for me

## create a tool for TODO pages :x:

Too lazy to do it myself so why not use python for me (I had to write this myself)
also helps in consistensy

## create a device protection manager for the commands :x:

Scans each file for any malicous scripts
Called I don't know maybe like border controll

### Has a trust system :x:

    If user doesnt give a trust for a file of 1 the computer defaults to 0.1
    Sandbox mode runs any script with minimum trust for the user to test
    
    If user gives a script a trust, it will ask if it should give 
    that same trust to the scripts that the original script relys on,
    saying that it has a lower trust.
