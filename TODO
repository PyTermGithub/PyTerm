# TODO :x:

Start date: `24 Jan 2024` - End Date: `not complete`

+ :white_check_mark: = complete
+ :x: = incomplete and not in progress
+ :arrow_left: = working on currently

## work more on package installer :x:

Add more paramaters and support for more package libraries (even if git is enough).

## create a command that lists all commands :white_check_mark:

Will probably just use `os.listdir('./PyMrk/Snippets)` or something like that

## create PyMrk/Man for Man pages :white_check_mark:

Developers can create files with their name to be read as man pages in the command `man {command name}`

This seems the simplest since my engine already has the tools inside of `pymrk_convert()` half done for me

## create a tool for TODO pages :arrow_left:

Too lazy to do it myself so why not use python for me (I had to write this myself)
also helps in consistensy

## create a device protection manager for the commands :x:

Scans each file for any malicous scripts
Called I don't know maybe like border controll

### Has a trust system :x:

    If user doesnt give a trust for a file of 1 the computer defaults to 0 (sandbox)
    
    If user gives a script a trust, it will ask if it should give 
    that same trust to the scripts that the original script relys on saying
    that those scripts has 0 trust
